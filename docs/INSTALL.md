# Universal Media Library - Installation Guide

## System Requirements

- Android 7.0 (API level 24) or higher
- At least 100 MB of free storage space

## Installation

1. Download the latest APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/Kaleaon/Android-calibre/releases) section
2. Enable "Install from unknown sources" in your Android settings if not already enabled
3. Open the downloaded APK file and follow the installation prompts

## First Run

When you first open the Universal Media Library app, you'll see an empty library screen. This is the intended first-run state.

### Getting Started

You have two main options to populate your library:

#### Option 1: Create a New Library
1. Tap the "+" button to create a new library
2. Enter a name for your library
3. Start adding media items manually

#### Option 2: Import from Calibre
1. Tap the menu button (⋮) in the top bar
2. Select "Import Calibre Library"
3. Choose your Calibre `metadata.db` file
4. Select the root folder of your Calibre library
5. The app will import your existing books and metadata

### Features Available in v1.0

- ✅ Basic library management interface
- ✅ Calibre library import
- ✅ Modern Material You design
- ✅ Local database storage
- ⏳ More features coming in future releases

## Troubleshooting

### App Won't Install

#### Most Common Fixes:
1. **Enable "Install from unknown sources"**: Go to Settings > Security > Unknown Sources (or Apps > Special access > Install unknown apps on newer Android versions)
2. **Check storage space**: Ensure you have at least 100 MB of free storage space
3. **Verify Android version**: Make sure your device runs Android 7.0 (API level 24) or higher
4. **Clear package installer cache**: Go to Settings > Apps > Package Installer > Storage > Clear Cache

#### APK Signing Issues (RESOLVED in latest version):
- ✅ **Fixed**: Previous versions had unsigned APKs which caused installation failures
- ✅ **Fixed**: All APKs are now properly signed with debug certificates for installation
- ✅ **Fixed**: Missing permissions for Android 13+ devices have been added

#### For Android 13+ Devices:
The app now properly requests notification permissions required for the import service.

#### If Installation Still Fails:
1. Try downloading the APK again (it may have been corrupted)
2. Restart your device and try installing again
3. Check if you have any security software blocking the installation
4. Try installing using a different file manager app

### App Permissions

The app requests the following permissions:
- **Internet**: For potential future online metadata fetching
- **Record Audio**: For text-to-speech functionality  
- **Post Notifications** (Android 13+): For import progress notifications
- **Foreground Service**: For long-running import operations

All permissions are used only for their stated purposes and no data is sent to external servers.

### Empty Library
This is expected behavior on first run. Use one of the methods above to add content to your library.
