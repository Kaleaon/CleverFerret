# Project Plan: Universal Media Library for Android

## 1. High-Level Vision

The goal is to create a new, fully self-contained, native Android application for managing a user's complete media library directly on their device. This includes books, comics, music, movies, podcasts, and more. The application will feature a modern, extensible, and user-friendly interface for organizing, viewing, and consuming all types of media, with powerful tools for metadata management.

## 2. Core Principles

*   **On-Device First:** The entire library and its database will be managed on the user's device. No external server or desktop application will be required.
*   **Extensible by Design:** The database schema and application architecture will be designed from the ground up to support a wide variety of media types.
*   **User-Centric Metadata:** The user will have full control over their metadata, with powerful tools for manual editing and automatic fetching from multiple online sources.
*   **Modern Native UI:** The application will be built with the latest Android technologies (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Material You).
*   **Open Source:** The project will be developed as a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) project.

## 3. Research Summary & Final Architecture (REVISED)

An extensive research and planning phase was conducted to determine the best architecture and components for this project. This section reflects the **revised architecture** based on our detailed investigation.

### Final Proposed Architecture (On-Device)

The project direction has been finalized. A **fully self-contained, on-device application is feasible**. This architecture does not require a separate computer or server.

1.  **Core Concept:** The application will be a native Android app that directly reads and manages a user's media library, which will be stored on the device's local storage.

2.  **Database Layer:** A new data layer will be built in **Kotlin** using standard Android SQLite libraries. It will be responsible for all database operations based on a custom, extensible schema designed for multiple media types. This layer will also handle the **advanced import and data cleaning of Calibre `metadata.db` files**.

3.  **Reader Component (epub4j):**
    *   The app will use the **`epub4j`** library as its core engine for parsing and handling e-book files.
    *   **License:** This library is licensed under the permissive **Apache 2.0 license**, which aligns with our project's FOSS goals without the restrictions of AGPL.
    *   **Feature Benchmark:** The feature set of **Moon+ Reader** will still be used as a benchmark for the quality and customization options to be built for the reading experience.

4.  **Audio Component (AntennaPod Model):**
    *   A dedicated audio player for music and audiobooks will be built, using the architecture of the **AntennaPod** project as a blueprint.

5.  **Video Component (ExoPlayer or libvlc):**
    *   The app will use a robust video playback engine. The default choice is **AndroidX Media3 (ExoPlayer)**.

6.  **UI/UX (Jetpack Compose & Material You):**
    *   The UI will be a modern, native Android interface built with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**.
    *   The design will be inspired by **`book-story`** (for its Material You aesthetic) and **`Plexoid`** (for its multi-library organizational concepts).

### Advanced Metadata Strategy

The application will feature a powerful, multi-layered strategy for metadata.

1.  **Automated Metadata Correction:**
    *   **OCR on Covers:** The app will use **Google's ML Kit Text Recognition** (Apache 2.0 license) to perform OCR on book covers to identify and correct titles and authors.
    *   **Text Analysis:** The app will use the **Apache OpenNLP** library (Apache 2.0 license) to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the first few pages of e-books to programmatically identify and correct metadata.

2.  **Manual Metadata Editing:**
    *   A dedicated UI will be built to allow users to manually edit all metadata fields. This screen will show a "before and after" comparison when automated corrections are applied, giving the user full control.

3.  **External Metadata Sources:**
    *   The app will enrich its library by fetching data from a wide range of sources:
        *   **Books:** Open Library API, **Google Books API**, **Hardcover API**.
        *   **Comics:** ComicVine API.
        *   **Audiobooks:** OverDrive API.
        *   **Movies/TV:** The Movie Database (TMDB) API, **OMDb API**.
        *   **Music:** MusicBrainz API, **Spotify Web API**.

4.  **Embedded Metadata Tooling:**
    *   **Reading:** The app will prioritize using standard Android libraries like `MediaMetadataRetriever` (for audio/video) and `ExifInterface` (for images) for reading embedded tags.
    *   **Writing:** For writing metadata, the app will use `ExifInterface` for images. For audio and video, specialized libraries will be chosen during implementation to ensure robust tag writing capabilities.

### Content Creation Features

The application will include features to create new content from external sources.

*   **News-to-Epub:** A feature to download news from various sources and format it into a `.epub` file.
*   **Fanfic-to-Epub:** A feature to download fanfiction from popular archives and format it into a `.epub` file.

---

## 4. Development Plan (REVISED)

### Phase 1: Foundational Research & Component Selection (COMPLETE)
*   E-Reader Component Investigation (Completed: `epub4j`)
*   Data Correction Technology Research (Completed: ML Kit & OpenNLP)
*   Expanded Metadata Source Research (Completed: New APIs identified)

### Phase 2: Architecture & Core Data Model (IN PROGRESS)
1.  **System Architecture Design:** Update `README.md` and `RESOURCES.md` to reflect the new architecture.
2.  **Advanced Database Schema and Import Logic:** Design the detailed SQLite schema and the logic for the Calibre import and data cleaning.
3.  **Design Manual Metadata Editing UI:** Create mockups and specifications for the metadata editing screen.

### Phase 3: Implementation
1.  **Implement Core Data Layer:** Build the database and the Calibre importer.
2.  **Implement "Content-to-Epub" Features:** Build the news and fanfiction downloaders.
3.  **Integrate Media Viewers & Players:** Integrate `epub4j` and build the audio/video players.
4.  **Build the User Interface:** Build the main library screens and the manual metadata editor.

### Phase 4: Testing and Polish
*   Perform end-to-end testing, paying special attention to the performance of `epub4j` and the accuracy of the data correction engine.
*   Refine the UI and user experience.
